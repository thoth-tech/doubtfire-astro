# SQL Injection Vulnerability Assessment

## 1. Introduction

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in applications that interact with databases. It occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, allowing attackers to manipulate databases by inserting malicious SQL statements.

### Examples of SQL Injection

**Basic Authentication Bypass:**
```sql
-- Original intended query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_password'

-- With SQL injection input: ' OR '1'='1
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'password'
```

This injection makes the WHERE clause always evaluate to true, potentially granting access without valid credentials.

**Data Extraction:**
```sql
-- With SQL injection input: admin' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--' AND password = 'password'
```

This injection attempts to retrieve all usernames and passwords from the database.

**Destructive Operations:**
```sql
-- With SQL injection input: '; DROP TABLE users;--
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP TABLE users;--' AND password = 'password'
```

This injection attempts to delete the entire users table.

## 2. Test Cases

The following test cases were executed to assess the application's resistance to SQL injection attacks:

1. **Authentication Bypass Tests:**
   - Testing `' OR '1'='1` in username and password fields
   - Testing `admin' --` to comment out password verification

2. **Data Extraction Tests:**
   - Testing `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --` to retrieve sensitive data

3. **Destructive Operation Tests:**
   - Testing `' OR '1'='1'; DROP TABLE users; --` to attempt database destruction

4. **Other Common Patterns:**
   - Testing `admin'; SELECT * FROM users; --` to execute additional queries

5. **Baseline Verification:**
   - Testing legitimate credentials to verify normal functionality

## 3. Methodology

### Prerequisites

To execute the tests, you will need:

1. A running instance of the Doubtfire application (both API and web client)
2. Basic understanding of bash scripting
3. cURL installed on your system
4. (Optional) Nikto web vulnerability scanner

### Test Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thoth-tech/doubtfire-astro.git
   cd doubtfire-astro
   ```

2. **Navigate to the security test scripts directory:**
   ```bash
   cd docs/src/content/security/scripts
   ```

3. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x test-sql-injection.sh
   ```

4. **Review and configure the script if needed:**
   The script is pre-configured with the following settings:
   - API URL: http://localhost:3000
   - Client URL: http://localhost:4200
   - Admin credentials: username "aadmin", password "password"
   - Student credentials: username "student_1", password "password"

   Modify these values in the script if your environment differs.

5. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   ./test-sql-injection.sh
   ```

6. **Interpret the results:**
   - Green checkmarks (✓) indicate successful blocks of injection attempts
   - Red X marks (✗) indicate potential vulnerabilities
   - Yellow question marks (?) indicate inconclusive tests

   The script will provide a summary at the end with counts of passed, failed, and inconclusive tests.

   > **Important:** The script may show "Valid login failed" in the test summary even when your authentication system is working correctly. This occurs because the script expects a specific response format (200 status code with an auth_token in the response), while your API might use a different format (e.g., 201 status code with user data). This limitation does not affect the SQL injection test results.

### Understanding Results

The script tests each SQL injection payload against both username and password fields, checking:

1. **Response status codes:** 401, 403, or 400 status codes typically indicate proper validation
2. **Response content:** Error messages that indicate input validation but don't expose database details
3. **Normal functionality:** Verification that legitimate credentials still work as expected

If Nikto is installed, it will also perform a broader vulnerability scan of the application.

## 4. Test Results

### Authentication Endpoint Tests

When executing the script against our test environment, we observed the following results:

#### Username Field Tests:
- All injection attempts were blocked with 401 status codes
- Error messages were properly sanitized without revealing database details
- 6/6 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 inconclusive

#### Password Field Tests:
- All injection attempts were blocked with 401 status codes
- Error messages were properly sanitized without revealing database details
- 6/6 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 inconclusive

#### Baseline Functionality:
- Valid credentials test shows as "failed" in script output, but this is only because the script expects a 200 status code and specific response format
- The application actually returns a 201 status code with valid user data, indicating the authentication system is working correctly
- This script limitation doesn't affect the SQL injection test results

#### Security Scan:
- Nikto scan completed without detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Some minor HTTP header recommendations were identified (X-Frame-Options, Content-Type-Options)

### Overall Assessment

The application demonstrated strong resistance to SQL injection attacks at the authentication endpoints. All common SQL injection patterns were properly identified and blocked with appropriate status codes and error handling.

> **Note:** Although the script reports "Valid login failed" in the test summary, this is due to a technical limitation in the script's validation logic (expecting a 200 status code and specific response format), not an actual issue with the application's authentication mechanism. The application correctly returns user data with a 201 status code when valid credentials are provided.

## 5. Actions Required

Based on our findings, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Documentation Update:**
   - Add SQL injection prevention techniques to the developer documentation
   - Create training material for new developers on secure coding practices

2. **Security Headers Implementation:**
   - Implement X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking attacks
   - Add X-Content-Type-Options header to prevent MIME type sniffing

3. **Regular Security Testing:**
   - Implement automated SQL injection testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline
   - Schedule quarterly security audits with broader scope

4. **Input Validation Review:**
   - Review other data entry points in the application for similar protection
   - Consider implementing a central input validation service

5. **Error Handling Enhancement:**
   - Review error messages across the application to ensure they don't leak sensitive information
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns across all endpoints

6. **Script Improvements Implemented:**
   - Changed all hardcoded URLs to use the variables defined at the top of the script
   - Updated curl commands to use `$TARGET_URL` instead of hardcoded URLs
   - Made sure all references to URLs use the variables
   - Added command-line options for easier customization:
     - Added a `-a` option to set the API URL
     - Added a `-c` option to set the client URL
     - Added a `-u` option to set the student username
     - Added a `-p` option to set the student password
     - Added a `-h` option to show help
   - Added auto-detection of API URLs from project configuration files
   - Added support for configuration through an external file
   - Improved error handling and reporting

These actions will further strengthen the application's security posture and ensure that SQL injection vulnerabilities remain properly mitigated.
